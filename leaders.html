    <h2>Nelson Mandela</h2>
    <img src="images/mandela.jpg" alt="Nelson Mandela">

    <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
    <p>
        Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in Mvezo village, South Africa.
        His birth name was Rolihlahla Mandela, meaning “troublemaker.”
        He grew up in the Thembu royal family and studied law, becoming one of
        the first Black lawyers in South Africa. He witnessed the injustice of
        apartheid — a system of racial segregation that denied Black citizens
        equal rights.
    </p>

    <h3>Fight Against Apartheid</h3>
    <p>
        Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) to fight for equality.
        He organized protests against apartheid laws. After violent government
        repression, he helped form a resistance movement. The government later
        declared him a criminal for his activism.
    </p>

    <h3>27 Years in Prison</h3>
    <p>
        In 1962 Mandela was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment.
        He spent 27 years in prison, mostly on Robben Island.
        Despite harsh conditions and hard labor, he became a global symbol
        of hope, resistance, and courage.
    </p>

    <h3>Freedom and Presidency</h3>
    <p>
        Mandela was released in 1990. He promoted peace and unity instead
        of revenge. In 1994, South Africa held its first democratic election.
        Mandela became the first Black president and worked to unite the nation
        and end racial discrimination.
    </p>

    <h3>Legacy</h3>
    <p>
        Mandela served one presidential term and stepped down peacefully.
        He received many awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
        He died in 2013 but remains a global symbol of justice and forgiveness.
